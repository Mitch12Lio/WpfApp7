# Cipher Treasure Hunt
Easily and quickly encrypt clues using one of the ciphers' available for a game or hunt.

## Description
Every easter we have a Treasure Hunt.

Multiple kids (and adults) are designated a colour, and the hunt starts.  The first egg has a cipher/clue they need to decrypt, which is the clue to the location of the next egg, and so on and so forth until get lead to the respective treasure.

This application encrypts clues, assigns a colour, and indicates the general approximation of where each eggâ€™s hiding place will be located.  I print and cut the results, fill every egg with a specific cipher, in the correct order, divide them into their location, and, once the participants are abroad, hide them.  Once the participants are back, game on!
